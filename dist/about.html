        <h1>About GeoSearch</h1>
        <div class="about-geosearch">
            <p>
                <b>GeoSearch</b> is all about getting information about
                that place you have always been interested in. You can search for any
                location in the world and we'll get you information about that place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start by typing in the name of a place and then click on the search button
                and wait for the page to fetch the search results. When the results are ready
                a page will appear which has a map view and some information about the current weather
                of the place which was searched for.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be a red marker pointing to the location of the place that was searched
                for in the map and then there may be blue markers on the map. The blue marker will be pointing
                to landmarks or famous places around the location that was searched for.
            </p>
            <p>
                User can click on any of the blue markers on the map to view a picture and the name of the
                landmark to which the marker is pointing. However, not all landmarks may have a picture of it
                saved in the cloud. In that case the app will indicate that there is no photo for that landmark.
            </p>

            <p>
                Weather information that is retrieved about where the user searched for includes the current
                <b>humidity</b>, <b>weather</b>, <b>windspeed and direction</b>, and <b>temperature</b>.
                By default the temperature are returned in <b>celsius</b>, however user can choose <b>fahrenheit</b>
                as their preferred unit by clicking on the appropriate option displayed under the temperature
                value in the search results.
            </p>

            <p>
                User can also share the weather information of the place that was searched for.

                appear where the user will see the the weather information already quoted for him to share.
